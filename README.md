# Python-Battle-Simulator
A repo for my work in progress project 'Python Battle Simulator'

this is just a lil' project i'm workin' on in my free time as a fun thing to do when i feel like it ^^"

full of spaghetti code, will probably fix this later.

also BE WARNED, the RNG in this program is janky AF, usually leads to strings of either the player or the enemy getting a lot of consecutive turns in a row.

not gonna fix that though i like the janky charm that adds ^^', if you wanna change it though by all means :3, though if you're gonna edit and then upload
my program again, credit would be highly appreciated but it's not required.

Current version: 0.8.0 Beta (Codename: IT'S ALIIIVE!)

what you can do:

// Fight enemies!, only one though lmao

what you will be able to do once i program their functions/code in:

// items! use em' to heal yourself, damage enemies, and even apply buffs/debuffs!

// fight more enemies!, and even fight BOSSES too!

// level up and become stronk

// customise your character and edit their flavourtext!

// make your own enemies in a file and have the program load em' in so you can fight em!
